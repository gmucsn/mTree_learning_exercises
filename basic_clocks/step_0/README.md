# mTree Basic Clocks Tutorial - Step 0

In this step, we will be setting up our necessary directories for a microeconomic system, or MES.

The directories we will need to create are:
- config - This directory will contain your configuration files to run your MES
- mes - This directory will contain your actual python code

## Actions

The goal of this auction is to enable a certain flow of messages in our MES. This sequence diagram should provide some context as to where we intend to go with this exercise.
