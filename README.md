# mTree_learning_exercises

<!---
Comment 1 - We should add a link to the videos that should be watched before they start the tutorial.

Comment 2 - Will we have a different file for each learning exercise?

Comment 3 - Something like instructions below.  All links are broken and need to be fixed.

Comment 4 - Should we have them fork this repo.  We obviously don't want them to make changes to this repo.  Or can we do this somehow on a cloned repo.

## Instructions
These learning_exercises are a guided self-learning tour of mTree.  Before you can begin you should do the following:
1. Download and [install mTree]()
2. Watch the [Getting Started with mTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_T-J4cR0Cs) video.
3. You will then want to clone the repository to your computer. Cloning will allow you to get updates for this repository quickly. So use your command prompt, navigate to a directory you would like to keep the repository in and type: `git clone git@github.com:gmucsn/mTree_learning_exercises.git` . If this doesn't work, you might try to use the https location such as `git clone https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree_learning_exercises.git`
4. Navigate to the [cv auction](https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree_learning_exercises/tree/main/basic_auctions) folder in this repository and do the subfolders in sequence.
    * In each subfolder read the readme and follow the directions to add folders and code to build a step of the cv_auction.
    * A possible solution to this step will be shown in the next step.  You can build on this solution. 
    * Continue in this way until you have finsihed all the steps.
    * When you are finished building the cv_auction you will have learned most of the basic functionality of mTree.
5. Navigate to the [clock auction](https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree_learning_exercises/tree/main/basic_clocks) folder in this repository and do the subfolders in sequence.
6. Naviagate to the [trust_game](https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree_learning_exercises/tree/main/basic_trust_game) folder in the repository and do the subfolders in sequence.  
    * In this last exercise you will not be shown a solution to the exercise, but instead must complete it on your own.
